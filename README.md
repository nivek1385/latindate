# latindate
BASH script to output the date in Latin

I believe that num2roman came from this post on unix.com: https://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/253699-fun-numbers-roman-letters-num.html. I know I didn't write it myself and found it years ago online somewhere. The unix.com post seems to be the oldest evidence I can find of the script.
